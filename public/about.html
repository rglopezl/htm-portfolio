<p>Gabriel is a very uninteresting person. He's got this little but really worring adiction with videogames.
  And lately he's been trying to do something with his life while learning some programming skills. 
  I hope this is enough information about me. Anyways, I'm not willing to share anything else with some strangers who share
  my same goal in this course.

<p>I live in Quito, Ecuador. I am 26 years old and my favorite thing to do is to spende time with my girlfriend 
  and my dog Arthur. They both make me happy. Also, when I have enough time I love playing videogames of any kind; I just 
  enjoy any kind of videogame. Also, I have this little hobby of cooking anytime I can. My favorite dishes are:
  <ul>
    <li>Gordon Ramsay style steak.</li>
    <li>Pizza. (Any pizza)</li>
    <li>Anything new, because I love trying new food.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>I work as an English teacher for Prime English School of Languages. A little but really lovely
  and welcoming instite my girlfriend started as to fullfill her wish of having an institute. She is one of my biggest
  inspirations, and one of the reasons I got the will and mental strenght to start this journey of learning to program
  and to be a web developer.
